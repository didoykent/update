              <b>Angela: </b><i>Well, time's running out, and we need to draw things to a close. Lots of points have come up in the discussion, so I'll try and sum up what's been decided. If I leave anything out or I get anything wrong, please do correct me. The next step is to decide where we go from here...allocate tasks you know, who's going to do what... and then finally, we need to talk about timings and draw up a schedule. So, can we just go over what we've agreed? First, I think we all agreed that we can all do a lot more in our centres to cut down the amount of energy we use in-company. Sally?</i>
